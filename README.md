# Mercurius - Core Business Platform

## How to set this project up for local development

### On an Intel-based macOS system

#### Setup

- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (choose "ï£¿ Intel Chip").

- Install NVM (Node Version Manager) by running `brew install nvm`.

- Install all required PHP packages: `brew tap shivammathur/php && brew install php@8.2 composer`.

- Install other required packages: `brew install ffmpeg mysql-client`.

- Install the [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download#step-1-install-symfony-cli) (only follow "Step 1" of the instructions).

Now clone this repository and cd into the folder containing this `README.md` file.

- Start the database Docker container: `docker run --name mcbp-db -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -d mariadb:10.6.7 --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.

- Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`.

- Set up the database: `php bin/console doctrine:database:create`.

- Apply all database migrations: `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`.

- Set up Node.js: `nvm install && nvm use`.

- Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install --no-save`.

- Start the NPM-based build watcher: `npm run watch`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- Open a new Terminal window.

- In the new Terminal window, in the project folder, run the test suite: `bash bin/run-tests.sh`.

- If this succeeds, run `~/.symfony5/bin/symfony server:start`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- Open a new Terminal window.

- In the new Terminal window, in the project folder, run the background jobs process: `php bin/console --no-debug messenger:consume async`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser. Enjoy!


#### Getting back to work

Coming from the setup described above, you should always be able to get back to work after "destructive" events (like reboots) by doing the following (most command require you to `cd` into the project folder containing this `README.md` file):

- Make sure that your Terminal sessions use the right PHP version - `php --version` should show `PHP 8.2.0` or higher. If not, try to fix this by running `brew unlink php && brew link --force php`.

- Make sure that the MariaDB database Docker container is running: `docker start mcbp-db`.

- Applying database migrations is idempotent and never hurts: `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`.

- In a dedicated Terminal window, start the NPM-based build watcher: `nvm install && npm run watch`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- In the new Terminal window, run the background jobs process: `php bin/console --no-debug messenger:consume async`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- In a dedicated Terminal window, start the Symfony web server: `~/.symfony5/bin/symfony server:start`. Keep the terminal window open and running in the background.

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser. Enjoy!


#### Ensuring up-to-date dependencies and DB structure after pulling changes

After pulling changes from the repository, you should always run the following command (this command requires you to `cd` into the project folder containing this `README.md` file):

- `bash bin/update-dev-system.sh`

#### Architecture

##### Communication betweet top-level components

All elements within a component (like \App\VideoBasedMarketing\Account) can simply talk to all other elements within the same component. They can also talk to all elements within the \App\Shared namespace. The folder structure within a component is not relevant for communication, it's only relevant for organization.

If an element in component A needs to communicate with an element in component B, there are two options:

- If the element in component A needs to call a method of an element in component B because it depends on the return value of that method call, the element in component B must be injected into the element in component A, to be used directly.

- If an element in component B needs to be triggered by element A, but element A doesn't depend on a return value from the element in component B, then then component A must dispatch an event, and component B must subscribe to that event accordingly.
